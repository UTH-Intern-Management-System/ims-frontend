# Store Directory

This directory is prepared for future state management implementation.

## Current State
- Using React Context API for state management
- All state is managed through custom hooks and context providers

## Future Plans
- Can be extended with Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries
- Centralized state management for complex applications
- Better performance optimization for large state trees

## Files
- `index.js` - Store configuration and exports
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Usage
```javascript
// Current usage with Context API
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';
import { useTheme } from '../context/ThemeContext';

// Future usage with centralized store
import { useStore } from './index';
```
